<p class="accessibility-hidden">The numbers at a glance:</p>

        between these periods.
        </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="accessibility-hidden">In more detail:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>2,310 people in Lewisham tested positive for COVID-19 in the last seven days.</li>
    <li>By comparison, 2,570 people tested positive in the previous seven-day period.</li>
    <li><strong>There were 260 fewer new cases, which is a reduction of 10.1%</strong>,
         compared to the previous seven-day period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since 31 January 2022, national reporting of COVID-19 cases has changed to also include possible reinfections. Our case numbers follow the new definition, which means our calculation of cases includes both new infections and reinfections.</p>
 
<p>Note that these numbers are not directly comparable between neighbouring boroughs, or with London as a whole, as population sizes of these places vary widely. See the the next section on case rates if you want to compare COVID-19 infection levels between different places.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about infection <a href="https://lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/coronavirus-covid-19/health/public-health" target="_top">check how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19</a>, and <a href="https://lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/coronavirus-covid-19/get-tested-for-covid19/rapid-testing-for-covid19" target="_top">get tested for COVID-19 if you have symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>Case rate</h2>
<p>Number of cases per 100,000 people in Lewisham, London, and England, between 24 January 2022 and 30 January 2022.</p>

<p class="accessibility-hidden">At a glance:</p>
<ul class="data-cards">
    <li><span class="title">Case rate in Lewisham</span> 
        <span class="content">756.6 <span class="accessibility-hidden">new cases per 100,000 people.</span></span></li>

        <span class="content">895.0 <span class="accessibility-hidden">new cases per 100,000 people.</span></span></li>
    <li><span class="title">Case rate in England</span> 
        <span class="content">1,043.6 <span class="accessibility-hidden">new cases per 100,000 people.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="accessibility-hidden">In more detail:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><strong>Lewisham had a lower case rate than London</strong> over the last seven days, which means infections were less widespread in Lewisham than in London as a whole.
        </li>
    <li><strong>Lewisham had a lower case rate than England</strong> over the last seven days, which means infections were less widespread in Lewisham than in England as a whole.
        </li>
    <li>In Lewisham, <strong>the case rate for people age 60 and over was lower than the overall case rate</strong>, at a level of 424.8 per 100,000 residents. This means that people of age 60 and over in Lewisham were less likely to be infected than the overall population of the borough.
        </li>
</ul>

<h3>What do these numbers mean and why is the case rate important?</h3>

<p>The case rate allows us to compare infection levels between places that have very different population sizes. It is calculated as the total number of COVID-19 cases in a region over seven days, divided by the population size of the region.</p>
