        <p class="info">A change of 
        <span class="good">
        -23 cases</span>
        between periods.
        </p></li>
</ul>
<p class="accessibility-hidden">In more detail:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>24 people in the borough tested positive for COVID-19 in the last seven days, while 47 people tested positive in the previous seven-day period.</li>
    <li><strong>There were 23 fewer new cases, which is a reduction of 48.9%</strong>,
         compared to the previous seven-day period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since 31 January 2022, national reporting of COVID-19 cases has changed to also include possible reinfections. Our case numbers follow the new definition, which means they include both new infections and reinfections.</p>
 
<p>Note that these numbers are not directly comparable between neighbouring boroughs, or with London as a whole, as population sizes of these places vary widely. See the next section on case rates if you want to compare COVID-19 infection levels between different places.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about infection <a href="https://lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/coronavirus-covid-19/health/public-health" target="_top">check how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19</a>, and <a href="https://lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/coronavirus-covid-19/get-tested-for-covid19/rapid-testing-for-covid19" target="_top">get tested for COVID-19 if you have symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>Case rate</h2>
<p>Number of new cases per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, between 9 April 2023 and 15 April 2023.</p>

<p class="accessibility-hidden">At a glance:</p>
<ul class="data-cards">
    <li><h3>Case rate in Lewisham</h3> 
        <p class="content">7.9 <span class="accessibility-hidden">new cases per 100,000 people.</span></p></li>
    <li><h3>Case rate in London</h3> 
        <p class="content">13.3 <span class="accessibility-hidden">new cases per 100,000 people.</span></p></li>
    <li><h3>Case rate in England</h3> 
        <p class="content">22.4 <span class="accessibility-hidden">new cases per 100,000 people.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="accessibility-hidden">In more detail:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><strong>Lewisham had a lower case rate than London</strong> over the last seven days, which means infections were less widespread in the borough than in London as a whole.
        </li>
    <li><strong>Lewisham had a lower case rate than England</strong> over the last seven days, which means infections were less widespread in the borough than in England as a whole.
        </li>
    <li><strong>In Lewisham, the case rate for people aged 60 and over was higher than for the overall population of the borough</strong>, at 18.9 cases per 100,000 residents. This means people aged 60 and over were more likely to be infected than the overall population of the borough.
        </li>
</ul>

<h3>What do these numbers mean and why is the case rate important?</h3>

<p>The case rate allows us to compare infection levels between regions and population groups that have very different sizes. A higher case rate means COVID-19 infections are more widespread in a region, relative to the size of the population. The case rate is calculated as the total number of new COVID-19 cases in a region over a period of seven days, divided by the population size of the region, and multiplied by 100,000.</p>

<h2>Vaccinations</h2>
<p>Percentage of residents in the borough age 12 and over who have received a COVID-19 vaccination dose as of Wednesday, 19 April 2023.</p>
<p class="accessibility-hidden">At a glance:</p>
<ul class="data-cards">
    <li><h3>First dose</h3>
        <p class="content">67.3% <span class="accessibility-hidden">of residents.</span></p></li>
    <li><h3>Second dose</h3>
        <p class="content">63.3% <span class="accessibility-hidden">of residents.</span></p></li>
    <li><h3>Third dose or booster</h3> 
        <p class="content">46.6% <span class="accessibility-hidden">of residents.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="accessibility-hidden">In more detail:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><strong>204,714 people in the borough have had their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine</strong>, meaning 67.3% of the population in the borough aged 12 years and over have received the first dose of their COVID-19 vaccination.</li>
